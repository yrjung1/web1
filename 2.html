    At a recent Virgin Unite gathering, a group of local British Virgin Islands students joined the discussions. One of our young guests was Tatiana (I was taking notes!), who joined us to listen to talks from the likes of The Elders co-founder Gra√ßa Machel and denuclearization campaigner Erika Gregory. I sat next to her and was delighted to see her taking detailed, handwritten notes.
